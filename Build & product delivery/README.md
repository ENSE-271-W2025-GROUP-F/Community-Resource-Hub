### This is the last part of our journey to make Charity Resource Hub

In this final phase: 
We performed a presentation during in-class time, including a: 
- Comprehensive Demo
- Reiteration of North Star & Carry Over customer
- Reiteration of Problem
- Discussion of Wordpress Implementation
- Question Period
Present here were two reps from the SSCF.

Next we emailed a back-up of our Wordpress site to our project sponsor. 

So, located here is our updated Story Map, our presentation slides, and our final Project Report.
